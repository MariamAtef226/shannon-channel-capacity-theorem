# shannon-channel-capacity-theorem

### Project Description :page_facing_up:
A simulation for the bandwidth-power tradeoff plot using Shannon's Channel Capacity Theorem. The Simulation is applied for the following 3 types of modulation: M'ary PSK, M'ary QAM and M'ary FSK. The code goes as follows:
1. Generating relation between energy efficiency and BER for each of 3 modulations at different Ms & plot it.
2. Assume max error of Pe < 10^-5: get corresponding energy efficiency to Pe = 10^-5 for each of the 3 modulations at different Ms.
3. Plot Capacity Boundary Curve of Shannon's Theorem.
4. Plot the retrieved points at step 2 on the same plot of step 3.
